<p>I didn’t grow up with artistic parents; I grew up with an electrical engineer and a purchasing clerk. Oh, and a brother who couldn’t do anything remotely artistic to save his life. My mother paints a little and my father can draw better than the average person, but somehow they made a graphic designer.</p>
<p>I didn’t always know that I wanted to be a graphic designer. Up until grade 11, I wanted to be a vet. I was introduced to the graphic design world by my high school co-op. I was placed in a graphic designing firm for half a year, and it was here that I fell in love with the profession.</p>
