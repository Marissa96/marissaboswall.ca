<h2 class="green">The Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this project was not for the poster but for a magazine spread. I was given 5 articles and told to pick one. I immediately gravitated towards "Ransom-Note Writing Tips". Even though the goal was a magazine spread, I ended up liking the poster by itself better. The only requirement for the poster was the quote had to be written using cut out magazine letters. The problem I faced was creating something no one else was going to think of.</p>

<h2 class="green">My Solution</h2>
  <p>Everyone was using ripped cardboard or cut jeans for texture, but I wanted to be different. I dug into my inner “dark-side” and got into the mindset that I was actually writing a ransom note to someone. Right away I thought of using red paint to simulate blood splattering on the paper. I also thought about giving the letters a little extra texture by ripping them out instead of cutting them.</p>
