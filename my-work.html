    <h2>Quote Book</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to create a book full of various quotes all relating to one topic. The book had to have hand-lettering and typeset portions. The size, topic and binding was up to us to decide. Immediately, I started getting hand-lettering ideas for bold, and dark quotes. Thatâ€™s when I decided to create my book based on depression.</p>

    <h2>Randsom Note Poster</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project was not for the poster but for a magazine spread. I was given 5 articles and told to pick one. I immediately gravitated towards "Ransom-Note Writing Tips"</p>

    <p>I was given free-rain with this project. I could do whatever I wanted but the end result had to showcase custom photography, type and be 8 x 10. </p>

    <h2>Cosmetic Billboard</h2>
    <p>For this project, we were given photos and asked to create a cosmetic billboard for our choice of company. The requirements were specific sizes and we had to edit the model photos ourselves.</p>

    <p>This project was focused around picking a pre-existing package and re-designing it to make it better. The only requirement was that we had to use all the content from the old packaging on our new packaging.</p>

    <h2>WWF Booklet</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was the take a text document we were given and turn it into a promotional booklet. The problem was creating something that the viewers/receivers would want to read and keep instead of throwing away.</p>
