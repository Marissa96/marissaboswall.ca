<h2 class="green">The Purpouse</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this project was to create a book full of various quotes all relating to one topic. The book had to have hand-lettering and typeset portions. The size, topic and binding was up to us to decide. Immediately, I started getting hand-lettering ideas for bold, and dark quotes. That’s when I decided to create my book based on depression.</p>
  <p>Depression runs in my family on the female side and I’ve seen it destroy the people I love. I was going to create a book people with and without depression could appreciate.</p>

<h2 class="green">My Solution</h2>
  <p>I created this book to help those with depression understand that they aren’t alone, and for those without to understand what its like to have depression. Suffering from depression myself, I know what its like to feel alone and misunderstood. I have personally felt every quote and their meaning in this book.</p>
  <p>Each quote has its own hand-lettering style to emphasis the emotion and feeling behind the quote. The hand lettering is meant to be bold and striking (and even upsetting) to give the viewer the sense of pain people with depression experience. </p>
  <p>The paragraphs on the side are clinical reasons why people experiencing the quotes, are feeling the way they are. They are meant to give the people suffering peace of mind in knowing that it’s not their fault they feel the way they do. They are also meant to show the people without depression the same thing; depression isn’t something someone can “snap out of”.</p>
