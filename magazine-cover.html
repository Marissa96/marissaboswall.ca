<h3>The Purpouse</h3>
  <p>I was given free-rain with this project. I could do whatever I wanted but the end result had to showcase custom photography, type and be 8 x 10.</p>

<h3>My Solution</h3>
  <p>Everyone was doing glamour shots, so me wanting to be different, decided to show case my make-up skills. I had previously done Comic Book make-up on myself for Halloween, and loved it.</p>
  <p>Four hours (give or take an hour) later, my model was ready. Ya, I sat there for four hours painting her face, neck and chest; drawing those stupid little dots. I used a solid background to keep the focus on the model and my amazing make-up skills.</p>
  <p>When I take photos, like any good photographer, I take hundreds and hundreds. So itâ€™s a pain to go through them all. I take photos from different angles to ensure I get at least one I really like. I knew I wanted my model to be positioned on the page differently than normal magazine models, so most of my photos were taken on an angle.</p>
