<h2 class="green">The Purpose</h2>
  <p>This project was focused around picking a pre-existing package and re-designing it to make it better. The only requirement was that we had to use all the content from the old packaging on our new packaging.</p>
  <p>The problem was picking which pre-existing package to re-design.</p>

<h2 class="green">My Solution</h2>
  <p>After awhile of searching, I came across a product I actually had. The Bop is a little Bluetooth speaker with a suction cup on the bottom. The original packaging was just the product covered with plastic and a little card insert saying what it is and what it does.</p>
  <p>The Bop comes with a cord so the consumer can recharge it. It also comes in various colours.</p>
  <p>When designing the packaging, I kept in mind how it would be shipped and stacked on the shelves. The Bop goes on the bottom while the cord goes on top, forming a pyramid. The colour on the outside of the box indicates the colour of the product on the inside.</p>
