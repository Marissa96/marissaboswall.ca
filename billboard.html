<h2 class="green">The Purpose</h2>
  <p>For this project, we were given photos and asked to create a cosmetic billboard for our choice of company. The requirements were specific sizes and we had to edit the model photos ourselves. </p>

<h2 class="green">My Solution</h2>
  <p>Personally, I’m the type of girl that hates wearing a lot of makeup so I chose to advertise simple cover up for my billboard. I chose Revlon because they like doing things (like how they place their word mark on a page) differently. I also chose to feature their long lasting cover up because I’m a HUGE fan of long lasting makeup (less work for me having to re-apply all the time). Since I’m the type of person that doesn’t wear a lot of makeup, I Photoshopped the model to be as natural as possible. I took off the ugly lip liner she was wearing and enhanced her eyes. I enhanced the eyes because the eyes are the first things people tend to notice about another person; also because I love eyes.</p>
  <p>The background is used to emphasis the long lasting part of the makeup and to give the billboard some depth.</p>
