<h2 class="green">The Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this project was the take a text document we were given and turn it into a promotional booklet. The problem was creating something that the viewers/receivers would want to read and keep instead of throwing away.</p>

<h2 class="green">My Solution</h2>
  <p>The WWF not only cares for animal life but human life as well; hence the title, Life. A tactic of the WWF’s advertising department is to pull on people’s heartstrings and make them feel bad for the animals, which will make them donate money. They also make bold and in your face statements. Both of these tactics are the reasons why I chose the photos I did. The dead on, close up photos make the viewers feel connected with the animals as well as provided a bold impact.</p>
